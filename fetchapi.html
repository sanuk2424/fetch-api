/*

The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources
(including across the network).
It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API
provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

fetch() method

The fetch() method of the Window Or WorkerGlobalScope mixin starts the process of fetching a
resources from the network, returning a promise which is fullfilled once the response is available.
The promise resolves to the Response object representing the response to your request.

It returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object.

Syntax:

fetch(resource,init)
resource --> This defines the resource that you wish to fetch.
It can be URL object, Request Object and URL of resource.


init(optional)-
        method --> The request method, eg. GET, POST
        
        headers --> Any headers you want to add to your request, contained 
        within a Headers object or an object literal with ByteString values.
       
        body-->Any body that you want to add to your request: this can be Blob, 
        BufferSource,FormData,URLSearchParams,USVString, or ReadableStream object. 
        Note that a request using the GET or HEAD method cannot have a body.


        mode -->The mode you want to use for the request, eg. cors,no-cors,or same-origin.

        credentials --> The request credentials you want to use for the request:omit, same-origin,or
        include. To automatically send cookies for the current domain,this option must be provided
        Starting with Chrome 50, this property also takes a FederatedCredential instance or a
        PasswordCredential instance.

        cache-->The cache mode you want to use for the request.

        Example
        fetch('https://geekyshows.com/post',{

            method:'POST',
            headers:{
                'Accept':'application/json',
                'Content-Type':'application.json'
            },
            body:"Json String or String",
            cache:'default'

        })


    Body.arrayBuffer() --> It returns a promise that resolves with 
    an ArrayBuffer representation of the request body

    Body.blob() --> It returns a promise that resolves with a Blob representation of the request body.

    Body.formData() --> It returns a promise that resolves with a FormData representation of the request.

    Body.json() --> It returns a promise that resolves with a JSON representation of the request body.

    Body.text() --> It returns a promise that resolves with an USVString(text) representation of the request body.

    Note:
    A fetch() promise only rejects when a network error is encountered 
    (which is usually when there's a permission issues or similar)

    A fetch() promise does not reject on HTTP errors (404,etc.).
    Instead, a then() handler must check the Response.ok and /or 
    Response.status properties.
